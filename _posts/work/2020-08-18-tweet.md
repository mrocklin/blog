Tweets, like all writing, should respect the reader through brevity and structure.


## Caveats

First, I'm mostly talking about professional tweets, and less about pictures of
family outings, cute cats, or hilarious memes.  If that's how you use Twitter,
then please disregard this post (or make fun of it with a hilarious meme).


## Example Tweet

Of my last few tweets, I think that this best exemplifies brevity and structure.

## What I like about this structure

1.  Starts with a short, single-line explanation, followed by a line break.

    People skim, especially on Twitter.
    We need to get to the point immediately.
    The line break helps the eye focus on the summary/hook,
    and buys us a little bit of attention
    while the reader decides if they want to read more.

2.  Deliver valuable content in the middle

    After you've hooked the reader you can deliver some novel information.
    Here we follow with an enumerated list,
    including actual novel information like prices.
    Readers learn something on the internet, huzzah!

3.  A clickable link with an image

    Tweets with clickable images seem to get shared more often.
    I'm not a fan of including stock photos just for click bait (this
    disrespects the reader in my opinion), but if you are linking to a blogpost
    or video, it's nice if SEO is active enough to have a clickable thing on
    the bottom.

4.  Deliver personalized opinions

    As a social medium, Twitter is slightly more personal than a blogpost.
    When I write a blog I try to remain neutral and precise, perhaps to the
    detriment of my writing.  On Twitter state the occasional personal opinion
    or bias.  I think that a subtle tint of personality makes me feel better
    about my tweets, and maybe improves engagement too.

    People like it when humans act like humans sometimes.


## Things to avoid (in my opinion)

I personally filter out most tweets that are half [#hashtags]() and
[@mentions]().
In my experience these are usually written by professional marketing folks, and
I've learned to associate a bit less value to those tweets.

I also think, perhaps unusually, that the normal rules of writing apply.
I avoid walls of text, abbreviations, internet shorthands, and so on.

Finally, just because Twitter gave us 280 characters doesn't mean that we have to
use them :)


## Respect and engagement

We respect the reader through brevity and structure.
Readers who feel respected engage.
