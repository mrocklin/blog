I'm pleased to announce the release of Dask version 0.17.2.  This is a minor
release with new features and stability improvements.
This blogpost outlines notable changes since the 0.17.0 release on February
12th.

You can conda install Dask:

    conda install dask

or pip install from PyPI:

    pip install dask[complete] --upgrade

Full changelogs are available here:

-  [dask/dask](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/master/docs/source/changelog.rst)
-  [dask/distributed](https://github.com/dask/distributed/blob/master/docs/source/changelog.rst)

Some notable changes follow:


### Tornado 5.0

Tornado is a popular framework for concurrent network programming that Dask
relies on heavily.  Tornado recently released a major version update that
included both some major features for Dask as well as a couple of bugs.

The new `IOStream.read_into` method allows Dask communications (or anyone using
this API) to move large datasets more efficiently over the network with
fewer copies.  This enables Dask to take advantage of high performance
networking available on modern super-computers.  On the Cheyenne system, where
we tested this, we were able to get the full 3GB/s bandwidth available through
the Infiniband network with this change (when using a few worker processes).

Many thanks to [Antoine Pitrou](https://github.com/pitrou) and [Ben
Darnell](https://github.com/bdarnell) for their efforts on this.

At the same time there were some unforeseen issues in the update to Tornado 5.0.
More pervasive use of bytearrays over bytes caused issues with compression
libraries like Snappy and Python 2 that were not expecting these types.  There
is a brief window in `distributed.__version__ == 1.21.3` that enables this
functionality if Tornado 5.0 is present but will misbehave if Snappy is also
present.

### HTTP File System

Dask leverages a [file-system-like protocol](https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/2880)
for access to remote data.
This is what makes commands like the following work:

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

df = dd.read_parquet('s3://...')
df = dd.read_parquet('hdfs://...')
df = dd.read_parquet('gcs://...')
```

We have now added http and https file systems for reading data directly from
web servers.  These also support random access if the web server supports range
queries.

```python
df = dd.read_parquet('https://...')
```

As with S3, HDFS, GCS, ... you can also use these tools outside of Dask
development.  Here we read the first twenty bytes of the Pandas license:

```python
from dask.bytes.http import HTTPFileSystem
http = HTTPFileSystem()
with http.open('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev/pandas/master/LICENSE') as f:
    print(f.read(20))
```

```
b'BSD 3-Clause License'
```

Thanks to [Martin Durant](https://github.com/martindurant) who did this work
and manages Dask's byte handling generally.  See [remote data documentation](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/remote-data-services.html) for more information.


### Fixed a correctness bug in Dask dataframe's shuffle

We identified and resolved a correctness bug in dask.dataframe's shuffle that
resulted in some rows being dropped during complex operations like joins and
groupby-applies with many partitions.

See [dask/dask #3201](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/3201) for more information.


### Cluster super-class and intelligent adaptive deployments

There are many Python subprojects that help you deploy Dask on different
cluster resource managers like Yarn, SGE, Kubernetes, PBS, and more.  These
have all converged to have more-or-less the same API that we have now combined
into a consistent interface that downstream projects can inherit from in
`distributed.deploy.Cluster`.

Now that we have a consistent interface we have started to invest more in
improving the interface and intelligence of these systems as a group.  This
includes both pleasant IPython widgets like the following:

<img src="{{BASE_PATH}}/images/dask-kubernetes-widget.png" width="70%">

as well as improved logic around adaptive deployments.  Adaptive deployments
allow clusters to scale themselves automatically based on current workload.  If
you have recently submitted a lot of work the scheduler will estimate its
duration and ask for an appropriate number of workers to finish the computation
quickly.  When the computation has finished the scheduler will release the
workers back to the system to free up resources.

The logic here has improved substantially including the following:

-  You can specify minimum and maximum limits on your adaptivity
-  The scheduler estimates computation duration and asks for workers
   appropriately
-  There is some additional delay in giving back workers to avoid hysteresis,
   or cases where we repeatedly ask for and return workers


Related projects
----------------

Some news from related projects:

-   The young daskernetes project was renamed to [dask-kubernetes](http://dask-kubernetes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  This displaces a previous project (that had not been released) for launching Dask on Google Cloud Platform.  That project has been renamed to [dask-gke](https://github.com/dask/dask-gke).
-   A new project, [dask-jobqueue](https://github.com/dask/dask-jobqueue/) was
    started to handle launching Dask clusters on traditional batch queuing
    systems like PBS, SLURM, SGE, TORQUE, etc..  This projet grew out of the [Pangeo](https://pangeo-data.github.io/) collaboration
-   A Dask Helm chart has been added to Helm's stable channel
