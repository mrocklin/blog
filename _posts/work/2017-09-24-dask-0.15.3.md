and the Data Driven Discovery Initiative from the [Moore
Foundation](https://www.moore.org/).*

I'm pleased to announce the release of Dask version 0.15.3.  This release
contains stability enhancements and bug fixes.  This blogpost outlines
notable changes since the 0.15.2 release on August 30th.

You can conda install Dask:

    conda install -c conda-forge dask

or pip install from PyPI

    pip install dask[complete] --upgrade

Conda packages are available both on conda-forge channels.  They will be on
defaults in a few days.

Full changelogs are available here:

-  [dask/dask](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/master/docs/source/changelog.rst)
-  [dask/distributed](https://github.com/dask/distributed/blob/master/docs/source/changelog.rst)

Some notable changes follow.


Masked Arrays
-------------

Dask.array now supports [masked arrays similar to NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/maskedarray.html).

```python
In [1]: import dask.array as da

In [2]: x = da.arange(10, chunks=(5,))

In [3]: mask = x % 2 == 0

In [4]: m = da.ma.masked_array(x, mask)

In [5]: m
Out[5]: dask.array<masked_array, shape=(10,), dtype=int64, chunksize=(5,)>

In [6]: m.compute()
Out[6]:
masked_array(data = [-- 1 -- 3 -- 5 -- 7 -- 9],
             mask = [ True False  True False  True False  True False  True False],
       fill_value = 999999)
```


This work was primarily done by [Jim Crist]() and partially funded by the UK
Met office in support of the [Iris project](http://scitools.org.uk/iris/).


Constants in `atop`
-------------------

Dask.array experts will be familiar with the [atop
function](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/array-api.html#dask.array.core.atop), which powers a non-trivial amount of dask.array and is commonly used by people building custom algorithms.  This function now supports constants when the index given is `None`.

```python
atop(func, 'ijk', x, 'ik', y, 'kj', CONSTANT, None)
```

Memory management for workers
-----------------------------

Dask workers spill excess data to disk when they reach 60% of their alloted
memory limit.  Previously we only measured memory use by adding up the memory
use of every piece of data produce by the worker.  This could fail under a few
situations

1.  Our per-data estiamtes were faulty
2.  User code consumed a large amount of memory without our tracking it

To compensate we now also periodically check the memory use of the worker using
system utilities with the psutil module.  We dump data to disk if the process
rises about 70% use, stop running new tasks if it rises above 80%, and restart
the worker if it rises above 95% (assuming that the worker has a nanny
process).

**Breaking Change:** Previously the `--memory-limit` keyword to the
`dask-worker` process specified the 60% "start pushing to disk" limit.  So if
you had 100GB of RAM then you previously might have started a dask-worker as
follows:

    dask-worker ... --memory-limit 60e9  # before specify 60% target

And the worker would start pushing to disk once it had 60GB of data in memory.
However, now we are changing this meaning to be the full amount of memory given
to the process.

    dask-worker ... --memory-limit 100e9A  # now specify 100% target

Of course, you don't have to sepcify this limit (many don't).  It will be
chosen for you automatically.  If you've never cared about this then you
shouldn't start caring now.

Statistical Profiling
---------------------

Workers now poll their worker threads every 10ms and keep a running count of
which functions are being used.  This information is available on the
diagnostic dashboard as a new "Profile" page.  It provides information that is
orthogonal, and generally more detailed than the typical task-stream plot.

These plots are available on each worker, and an aggregated view is available
on the scheduler.  The timeseries on the bottom allows you to select time
windows of your computation to restrict the parallel profile.
