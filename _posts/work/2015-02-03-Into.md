**tl;dr `into` efficiently migrates data between formats.**

Motivation
----------

We spend a lot of time migrating data from common interchange formats, like
`CSV`, to efficient computation formats like an array, a database or binary
store.  Worse, many don't migrate data to efficient formats because they don't
know how or can't manage the particular migration process for their tools.

Your choice of data format is important.  It strongly impacts performance (10x
is a good rule of thumb) and who can easily use and interpret your data.

When advocating for [Blaze](http://continuum.io/open-source/blaze) I often say
"Blaze can help you query your data in a variety of formats."  This assumes
that you're able to actually get it in to that format.


Enter the `into` project
------------------------

The `into` function efficiently migrates data between formats.
These formats include both in-memory data structures like the following:

    list, set, tuple, Iterator
    numpy.ndarray, pandas.DataFrame, dynd.array
    Streaming Sequences of any of the above

as well as persistent data living outside of Python like the following:

    CSV, JSON, line-delimited-JSON
    Remote versions of the above
    HDF5 (both standard and Pandas formatting), BColz, SAS
    SQL databases (anything supported by SQLAlchemy), Mongo

The `into` project migrates data between any pair of these formats efficiently
by using a network of pairwise conversions.  (visualized towards the bottom of
this post)


How to use it
-------------

The `into` function takes two arguments, a source and a target.  It moves data
in the source to the target.  The source and target can take the following
forms

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <td> Target </td>
        <td> Source </td>
        <td> Example </td>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
        <td> Object </td>
        <td> Object </td>
        <td> A particular DataFrame or list </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> String </td>
        <td> String </td>
        <td> 'file.csv', 'postgresql://hostname::tablename' </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Type </td>
        <td>        </td>
        <td> Like list or pd.DataFrame </td>
    </tr>
</table>

So the following would be valid calls to `into`

{% highlight Python %}
>>> into(list, df)  # create new list from Pandas DataFrame
>>> into([], df)  # append onto existing list
>>> into('myfile.json', df)  # Dump dataframe to line-delimited JSON
>>> into(Iterator, 'myfiles.*.csv') # Stream through many CSV files
>>> into('postgresql://hostname::tablename', df)  # Migrate dataframe to Postgres
>>> into('postgresql://hostname::tablename', 'myfile.*.csv')  # Load CSVs to Postgres
>>> into('myfile.json', 'postgresql://hostname::tablename') # Dump Postgres to JSON
>>> into(pd.DataFrame, 'mongodb://hostname/db::collection') # Dump Mongo to DataFrame
{% endhighlight %}

Note that `into` is a single function.  We're used to doing this with various
`to_csv`, `from_sql` methods on various types.  The `into` api is very small;
Here is what you need in order to get started:

    $ pip install into

{% highlight Python %}
>>> from into import into
{% endhighlight %}

[See into on `github`](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/into/)

Examples
--------

We now show some of those same examples in more depth.

Turn list into numpy array

{% highlight Python %}
>>> import numpy as np
>>> into(np.ndarray, [1, 2, 3])
array([1, 2, 3])
{% endhighlight %}

Load CSV file into Python list

{% highlight Python %}
>>> into(list, 'accounts.csv')
[(1, 'Alice', 100),
 (2, 'Bob', 200),
 (3, 'Charlie', 300),
 (4, 'Denis', 400),
 (5, 'Edith', 500)]
{% endhighlight %}

Translate CSV file into JSON

{% highlight Python %}
>>> into('accounts.json', 'accounts.csv')
{% endhighlight %}

    $ head accounts.json
    {"balance": 100, "id": 1, "name": "Alice"}
    {"balance": 200, "id": 2, "name": "Bob"}
    {"balance": 300, "id": 3, "name": "Charlie"}
    {"balance": 400, "id": 4, "name": "Denis"}
    {"balance": 500, "id": 5, "name": "Edith"}

Translate line-delimited JSON into a Pandas DataFrame

{% highlight Python %}
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> into(pd.DataFrame, 'accounts.json')
   balance  id      name
0      100   1     Alice
1      200   2       Bob
2      300   3   Charlie
3      400   4     Denis
4      500   5     Edith
{% endhighlight %}


How does it work?
-----------------

This is challenging.  Robust and efficient conversions between any two pairs of
formats is fraught with special cases and bizarre libraries.  The common
solution is to convert through a common format like a DataFrame, or streaming
in-memory lists, dicts, etc. (see [`dat`](http://dat-data.com/))
or through a serialization format like
[ProtoBuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) or
[Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/).  These are excellent options and often
what you want.  Sometimes however this can be slow, particularly when dealing
with live computational systems or with finicky storage solutions.

Consider for example, migrating between a `numpy.recarray` and a
`pandas.DataFrame`.  We can migrate this data very quickly in place.  The bytes
of data don't need to change, only the metadata surrounding them.  We don't
need to serialize to an interchange format or translate to intermediate
pure Python objects.

Consider migrating data from a CSV file to a PostgreSQL database.  Using
Python iterators through SQLAlchemy we rarely exceed migration speeds greater
than 2000 records per second.  However using direct CSV loaders native to
PostgreSQL we can achieve speeds greater than 50000 records per second.  This
is the difference between an overnight job and a cup of coffee.  However this
requires that we're flexible enough to use special code in special situations.

*Expert pairwise interactions are often an order of magnitude faster than
generic solutions.*

Into is a network of these pairwise migrations.  We visualize that network
below:

</a>
<figcaption>Into's decentralized migration scheme.  Complex but powerful</figcaption>
</figure>

Each node is a data format.  Each directed edge is a function that transforms
data between two formats.  A single call to `into` may traverse multiple edges
and multiple intermediate formats.  For example, we when migrate a CSV file to
a Mongo database we might take the following route:

* Load in to a `DataFrame` (`pandas.read_csv`)
* Convert to `np.recarray` (`DataFrame.to_records`)
* Then to a Python `Iterator` (`np.ndarray.tolist`)
* Finally to Mongo (`pymongo.Collection.insert`)

Alternatively we could write a special function that uses MongoDB's native CSV
loader and shortcut this entire process with a direct edge `CSV -> Mongo`.

To find the most efficient route we weight the edges of this network with
relative costs (measured ad-hoc.)  We use `networkx` to find the shortest path
before we start the migration.  If for some reason an edge fails (raises
`NotImplementedError`) we can reroute automatically.  In this way we're both
efficient and robust to failure.

Note that we color some nodes *red*.  These nodes can be *larger than memory*.
When we migrate between two red nodes (both the input and output may be larger
than memory) then we limit our path to the red subgraph to ensure that we don't
blow up mid-migration.  One format to note is `chunks(...)` like
`chunks(DataFrame)` which is an iterable of in-memory `DataFrames`.  This
convenient meta-format allows us to use compact data structures like numpy
arrays and pandas DataFrames on large data while keeping only a few tens of
megabytes in memory at a time.

The networked approach allows developers to write specialized code for special
situations and know that this code will only be used in the right situation.
This approach allows us to handle a very complex problem in an isolated and
separable manner.  The central dispatching system keeps us sane.


History
-------

I wrote about into [long ago]({{BASE_PATH}}/work/2014-09-01-Blaze-into/) in
connection to Blaze.  I then promptly shut up about it.  This was because the
old implementation (before the network approach) was difficult to
extend/maintain and wasn't ready for prime-time.

I am *very happy* with this network.  Unexpected applications very often *just
work* and into is now ready for prime-time.  It's also available independently
from Blaze, both via [`conda`](http://continuum.io/open-source/conda) and via `pip`.  The
major dependencies are NumPy, Pandas, and NetworkX so it's relatively
lightweight for most people who read my blog.  If you want to take advantage of
some of the higher performing formats, like `HDF5`, you'll need to install
those libraries as well (pro-tip, use [`conda`](http://continuum.io/open-source/conda)).


How do I get started?
---------------------

You should download a recent version.

    $ pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/ContinuumIO/into
    or
    $ conda install into --channel blaze

You then might want to go through the first half of
[this tutorial](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/blaze-tutorial#into)

Or [read the docs](http://into.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

Or just give it a shot without reading anything.  My hope is that the interface
is simple enough (just one function!) that users can pick it up naturally.  If
you run in to issues then I'd love to hear about them at
`blaze-dev@continuum.io`
