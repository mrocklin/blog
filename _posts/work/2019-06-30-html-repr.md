Summary
-------

We highlight visual design in interactive software projects,
in effort to motivate more effort in this direction.

The Scientific Python stack has historically focused
on performance and API design
far more than visual user experience.
I think that we should reverse that trend for a while.


HTML outputs in Jupyter
-----------------------

In particular, I want to highlight a few positive examples
that use Jupyter's ability to add HTML output for any object.
This can either be full-fledged interactive widgets,
or just rich static outputs like tables or diagrams.


### Iris

I originally decided to write this post after reading another blogpost from the
UK Met office, where they included the HTML output of their library Iris in a
a [blogpost](https://medium.com/informatics-lab/creating-a-data-format-for-high-momentum-datasets-a394fa48b671)

Reducing the distance from everyday computing to publication-ready outputs
helps everybody.


### Shapely

```python
from shapely.geometry import Polygon

Polygon([(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)])
```

        stroke-width="0.0216"
        opacity="0.6"

### Logs

This logs widget provides collapsable log outputs from a set of workers in a
cluster.

width="100%">

The code for these is simple.  Here's the implementation for the logs widget

```python
class Log(str):
    """A container for logs."""

     def _widget(self):
        from ipywidgets import HTML
        return HTML(
            value="<pre><code>{logs}</code></pre>".format(logs=self)
        )

     def _ipython_display_(self, **kwargs):
        return self._widget()._ipython_display_(**kwargs)


 class Logs(dict):
    """A container for multiple logs."""

     def _widget(self):
        from ipywidgets import Accordion
        accordion = Accordion(children=[log._widget() for log in self.values()])
        [accordion.set_title(i, title) for i, title in enumerate(self.keys())]
        return accordion

     def _ipython_display_(self, **kwargs):
        return self._widget()._ipython_display_(**kwargs)
```

This solves a common usability problem, of getting blasted with a ton of output
in Jupyter and then having to scroll around.  Using relatively simple HTML
helps us avoid this deluge of information and makes it much more nicely
navigable.

### Xarray

Here is another [in a PR](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/1627) for Xarray.

It's all about optionally exposing information, you can play with it over at
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/benbovy/3009f342fb283bd0288125a1f7883ef2).

### Snakeviz

The [Snakeviz project](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/) makes it easy to
visualize and interact with profiling output.  (I personally love this project
(thanks [Matt Davis!](https://penandpants.com/))

Now that it can embed its output directly in Jupyter it's even easier to use.

### SymPy

SymPy uses unicode for its rich outputs.  This makes it valid both in the
notebook and also in the console.

     alt="SymPy rich output">

These outputs are critical when trying to understand complex mathematical
equations.  They make SymPy pragmatic for analyzing mathematical equations.


### PyMC3

As [Colin Carroll says](https://twitter.com/colindcarroll/status/1145326125943590912), "PyMC3 borrowed `_repr_latex_` from sympy, and
the graphviz graph from dask-delayed"

### Dask Array

Inspired by these I took a look at how we render Dask Arrays to the screen

```python
In [1]: import dask.array as da

In [2]: da.ones((10, 1024, 1024), chunks=(1, 256, 256))
Out[2]: dask.array<ones, shape=(10, 1024, 1024), dtype=float64, chunksize=(1, 256, 256)>
```

Which, while compact, could be improved.  I spent a day and made this.

     width="80%">

[dask/dask #4794](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/4794)

It was designed around common problems I've had in trying to convey information
about chunking to new users of the library (this commonly translates into
performance problems for novices).  I found myself relying on it for chunking
information almost immediately.  I think it will do a lot of good, it looks
nice, and was easy to implement.

### Final thoughts

We should do more of this.  It's easy and impactful.
