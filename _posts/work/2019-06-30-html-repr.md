Summary
-------

User interaction in data science projects can be improved by adding a small
amount of visual deisgn.

To motivate more effort around visual design we show a bunch of
simple-yet-useful examples.

This post was supported by replies to [this

HTML outputs in Jupyter
-----------------------

In particular, We focus on Jupyter's ability to add HTML output for any object.
This can either be full-fledged interactive widgets,
or just rich static outputs like tables or diagrams.


### Iris

I originally decided to write this post after reading another blogpost from the
UK Met office, where they included the HTML output of their library Iris in a
a [blogpost](https://medium.com/informatics-lab/creating-a-data-format-for-high-momentum-datasets-a394fa48b671)

The fact that the output provided by an interactive session is the same
output that you would provide in a published result helps everyone.  The
interactive user gets high quality feedback, and there is no
productionizing step as we move from the nitty-gritty of development to
polish of publication.


### Shapely

Shapely deals with shapes, such as are used in geographic information systems.
They render themselves just as shapes in Jupyter using SVG.

```python
from shapely.geometry import Polygon

Polygon([(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)])
```

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
     xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
     width="100.0"
     height="100.0"
     viewBox="-0.04 -0.04 1.08 1.08"
     preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin meet">
  <g transform="matrix(1,0,0,-1,0,1.0)">
  <path fill-rule="evenodd"
        fill="#66cc99"
        stroke="#555555"
        stroke-width="0.0216"
        opacity="0.6"
        d="M 0.0,0.0 L 0.0,1.0 L 1.0,0.0 L 0.0,0.0 z" />
  </g>
</svg>

Note that the image that you see above isn't an image like a PNG or JPEG.  It's
SVG.  If you were to look at the source of this post you would see the actual
values and content of the triangle.

### Logs

This logs widget provides collapsable log outputs from a set of workers in a
cluster.

width="100%">

The code for these is simple.  Here's the implementation for the logs widget

```python
class Log(str):
    """A container for logs."""

     def _widget(self):
        from ipywidgets import HTML
        return HTML(
            value="<pre><code>{logs}</code></pre>".format(logs=self)
        )

     def _ipython_display_(self, **kwargs):
        return self._widget()._ipython_display_(**kwargs)


 class Logs(dict):
    """A container for multiple logs."""

     def _widget(self):
        from ipywidgets import Accordion
        accordion = Accordion(children=[log._widget() for log in self.values()])
        [accordion.set_title(i, title) for i, title in enumerate(self.keys())]
        return accordion

     def _ipython_display_(self, **kwargs):
        return self._widget()._ipython_display_(**kwargs)
```

This solves a common usability problem, of getting blasted with a ton of output
in Jupyter and then having to scroll around.  Using relatively simple HTML
helps us avoid this deluge of information and makes it much more nicely
navigable.

### Xarray

Here is another [in a PR](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/1627) for Xarray.

     width="70%">

It's all about optionally exposing information, you can play with it over at
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/benbovy/3009f342fb283bd0288125a1f7883ef2).

### Snakeviz

The [Snakeviz project](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/) makes it easy to
visualize and interact with profiling output.  (I personally love this project
(thanks [Matt Davis!](https://penandpants.com/))

Now that it can embed its output directly in Jupyter it's even easier to use.

Jones](https://twitter.com/andy_l_jones/status/1145331500839256067) for the tip)


### SymPy

SymPy uses unicode for its rich outputs.  This makes it valid both in the
notebook and also in the console.

     width="50%"
     alt="SymPy rich output">

These outputs are critical when trying to understand complex mathematical
equations.  They make SymPy pragmatic for analyzing mathematical equations.


### PyMC3

As [Colin Carroll says](https://twitter.com/colindcarroll/status/1145326125943590912), "PyMC3 borrowed `_repr_latex_` from sympy, and
the graphviz graph from dask-delayed"

### Dask Array

Inspired by these I took a look at how we render Dask Arrays to the screen

```python
In [1]: import dask.array as da

In [2]: da.ones((10, 1024, 1024), chunks=(1, 256, 256))
Out[2]: dask.array<ones, shape=(10, 1024, 1024), dtype=float64, chunksize=(1, 256, 256)>
```

Which, while compact, could be improved.  I spent a day and made this.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/306380/57591783-b6da9300-74f8-11e9-9152-a1fe86dcf51c.png"
     width="80%">

[dask/dask #4794](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/4794)

It was designed around common problems I've had in trying to convey information
about chunking to new users of the library (this commonly translates into
performance problems for novices).  I found myself relying on it for chunking
information almost immediately.  I think it will do a lot of good, it looks
nice, and was easy to implement.


### Richer Visualization Libraries

The examples above are all fairly simple relative to proper visualization
or widget libraries like Bokeh, Altair, IPyLeaflet, and more.  These libraries
use far more sophisticated HTML/JS to get far more exciting results.

I'm not going to go too deeply into these more sophisticated libraries because
my main intention here is to encourage a broader use of rich outputs by the
rest of us, even those of us that are not sophisticated with web frontend
technologies.


### Final thoughts

We should do more of this.  It's easy and impactful.

Even if you know only a little bit of HTML you can probably have a large impact
here.  Even very sophisticated and polished libraries like NumPy or
Scikit-Learn have, I believe, a lot of low hanging fruit here.  It's a good
place to have impact.
