The other day I heard my parents arguing about whether or not it was safe to go to the grocery store:

-   **Mom:** It's very dangerous.  People are dying.
-   **Dad:** It's completely safe.  I wear a mask and keep distance.

In truth, going to the store is neither very dangerous, nor completely safe.
It's somewhere in the middle.  But where?

After speaking with my parents for a while I learned that they didn't have a
good mental model on how to think about quantitative risk.  This post is for them.
This post estimates the probability that an individual contracts
COVID before they get a vaccine.  To be specific, this post uses my parents,
who are in their seventies and live in Southern California.

## End result

Very roughly, I suspect that my parents are about 10% likely to contract COVID before getting vaccinated if they behave like everyone else.  I'm probably about 20% likely.


## Reasoning

-   Today the US sees around 300,000 cases per day, with a population 1000 times
    greater, at about 300,000,000

    So waking up each day, an American resident has about a 1 in 1000 chance of learning that they have COVID.

    If they wake up ten days in a row, they have about at 1 in 100 or 1% chance of learning that they have COVID

-   California is a hotspot in the country currently, and LA is a hotspot
    within California.

    Without checking numbers, I'm going to guess that this makes one about 2x more likely to get COVID on a day-by-day basis

-   My parents are older (sorry folks) and,
    like most people their age,
    have various health issues.
    They're likely to be early in line for a vaccine, but not first.
    Given logistical difficulties I suspect that they'll get a vaccine some time in March, about 50 days from now

-   So 1 in 500 chance of waking up with COVID every day for Californians

    x 50 days until vaccination

    results in a 1 in 10 chance of contracting COVID prior to receiving a vaccine in March

    *if* they act like their friends and neighbors

As a relatively healthy relatively young person, I'm probably closer to 1 in 5 (20%)
due to getting a vaccine a bit later in the year.

Please take this post more as an exercise for how to approximate risk,
rather than as an actual estimate of that risk.
