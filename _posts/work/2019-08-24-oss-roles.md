Software projects require a variety of non-technical work to succeed.
This post names and defines that work, using terms borrowed from industry.

This post follows and complements a post on the [Role of a
Maintainer](../../../2019/05/18/maintainer),
which is more focused on the day-to-day technical operation of the project.
While maintainers serve a critical and necessary role,
technical maintenance alone is not sufficient for success.


### Product Management

-  *What new domains and applications should we target for greatest impact?*
-  *What features do we need to focus on in order to satisfy those those domains?*

A maintainer keeps the project running,
but where should that project go?
Product management determines the direction that a project should go
on a longer timescale.
They work to understand the broder context in which the project exists,
and identifies opportunities within that context that could make the project more relevant.

### Project Management

-  *Are we making steady progress towards our goals?*
-  *If not, what is blocking us, and how can we address those problems?*
-  *Do our users agree?*

It's easy for developers to go off-track.

-   We may choose to work on interesting problems rather than important ones
-   We may misunderstand what users need,
    and so waste time on technically correct, but pragmatically unfruitful paths
-   We may get distracted by life, and so projects may become abandoned

Project managers keeps things moving forward in productive directions.
They listen to users and other stakeholders,
and keep development focused on important issues.
If something unexpected comes up and a developer has to stop work,
they try to organize things to maintain continuity.

Project management is hard in general, and particularly is OSS.
Project managers need to have the technical ability to make good decisions
and earn the respect of developers.
They also need to have enough personal skills to listen to users and stakeholders.
Additionally, project management is hard in OSS because
often we don't have clear employer/employee relationships with development teams.
This means that project managers need to find non-monetary ways to convince developers to work on
important rather than pleasant tasks.
This requires either a lot of creativity or a very understanding development team.


### Marketing

-  *Who would benefit from our project?*
-  *How do we speak to them?*
-  *What do we say to motivate them to take a look?*

Many excellent software projects go unused because people don't know that the project exists.
Often we can have more impact by telling people about current functionality
than by improving or building new functionality.

Marketing engages in communicating the capabilities of the project to those that might need that capability.
Depending on the communities that might use the project,
this might be anything from social media,
to writing academic papers,
to giving talks at conferences.

It can be challenging to know which of these methods work best,
and so effective marketing is also quite quantitative.
They observe traffic patterns on webpages,
send out surveys,
track engagement on social media,
and learn as much as they can to improve the projects' outreach.


### Sales

-   *How do we match the project's capabilities to the needs of a particular institution?*

As developers, we often think of sales and marketing as trying to trick people into buying software.
This is only true if your software is bad, and trickery is necessary.
Otherwise, sales and marketing are much more about having conversations with your users,
and determining which parts of your software solve which parts of their problem.

Where marketing is broad,
sales focuses on a particular institution that has already shown some interest.

Good sales is mostly about asking questions and listening well.

-   *Why are you interested in this software?  What do you hope to get out of it?*
-   *What are you doing now to solve this problem?*
-   *What are the pain points of this process?  Why are you looking for change?*

Once you have a good sense of what their pain points are
you can help them to understand how your software might help them, if it does,
or point them towards other solutions if it doesn't.
You likely know much more about this space than they do,
and they can use your expertise.

If you're spending time one-on-one with an institution then probably you want something from them.
In traditional business this might be money,
but in general this could be many things,
including engineering time, co-marketing, or you may just want to support a just cause.

In any event, sales is a retail match-making process and its often necessary in order to have impact with larger and slower-moving institutions.


### HR

-  *How is everyone doing?*
-  *Are they happy?  If not, why not, and what can we do about it?*
-  *How do we make our current community members as efficient as possible?*
-  *How do we add new members to our community and where can we focus this effort?*
-  *How do we build the skills of our current team, and how do we help them move on when that time comes?*

Software is built by people and people have needs.

For example it may be that one of your teammates is suffering from repetitive stress injuries or mental health issues,
and the most productive action you could take isn't to fix another bug,
but to send them an ergonomic keyboard, or a map of hiking trails in their area.

Or there may be tension in the community caused by a personality mismatch,
and you need to engage in conflict management to keep things smooth.

People's lives change.
They have kids, get new jobs, retire, need vacations, or need help finding new positions.
It's important to be there with them, celebrate and console them,
helping logistically in whatever way makes sense.


### The status today

There are people in every successful project that serve these roles today,
at least to some extent.
We may use different terms like "outreach" over "sales and marketing"
or "emotional work" over "HR", but the concepts are the same.
My hope is providing concrete names and examples of this non-technical work
makes it easier to discuss its role in our projects,
and promote and celebrate these efforts among our peers.
